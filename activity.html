            What is software project management?
        </h1>
        <p class="p1">
            Software in project management is dedicated to the planning, scheduling, resource allocation, execution, tracking, and delivery of software and web projects.
<br>
Project management in software engineering is distinct from traditional project management — software in project management has a unique life cycle process that requires multiple rounds of <br> testing, updating, and customer feedback. Most IT-related projects are managed in the Agile style to keep up with the increasing pace of business and iterate based on customer and <br> stakeholder feedback.

            The role and responsibility of a software project manager <br>
Software project managers may have to do any of the following tasks:
        </h1>
        <p class="p1">
            
Planning: The software project manager puts together the blueprint for the entire project. The project plan will define the scope, necessary resources, timeline, procedure for execution, communication strategy, and steps required for testing and maintenance.
Leading: A software project manager assembles and leads the project team, which consists of developers, analysts, testers, graphic designers, and technical writers. Heading up a team requires excellent communication, people, and leadership skills.
Execution: The person who manages software projects will supervise the successful execution of each stage of the project. This includes monitoring progress, conducting frequent team check-ins, and creating status reports.
Time management: Staying on schedule is crucial to the successful completion of any project. This can be particularly challenging with the management of software projects because changes to the original plan are almost guaranteed as the project evolves. Software project managers must be experts in risk management and contingency planning to ensure progress in the face of roadblocks or changes.
Budget: Like traditional project managers, professionals who manage software projects are tasked with creating a budget for a project and sticking to it as closely as possible, moderating spending and reallocating funds when necessary.
Maintenance: Project management in software encourages constant product testing to discover and fix bugs early, adjust the end product to the customer’s needs, and keep the project on target. The software project manager ensures the product is properly and consistently tested, evaluated, and adjusted accordingly
