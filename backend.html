        Software Programming Definition -
    </h1>
    <p class="p1">
        Software programming is the act of writing computer code that enables computer software to function. The computer technology field often has <br>overlapping terminology that can be confusing to discern. Software programming is not the same as software development. Development is the <br>actual design of a program while programming is the carrying out of the instructions of development. People who program software are <br>called computer programmers.

    <h1 class="head">Types of Software Programming
    </h1>
    <p class="p1">Software programs are usually categorized into the programming languages that are compatible with them. There are many types of <br>
        programming languages in existence, but below is a list of some well-known codes and what they are used for.
<br>
        <br>JavaScript. JavaScript is commonly used on websites to add interactive elements.
        <br>
    <br>    SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a database query language that allows websites to transfer data from large databases.
       <br> Python. Python is a language used for a wide variety of things, from web apps to data analysis.
        <br>Java. Java is typically used in video games and mobile apps, including apps for Android devices.
        <br>C#. Comparable to Java, C# is used for Microsoft apps.
       <br> Many of these programs offer certification from the company that developed them. For instance, Oracle has the Oracle Certified Associate <br>
       Java Programmer (OCAJP) and the Oracle Certified Professional Java Programmer (OCPJP) certification. Certification typically involves passing <br>an example getting certified is an important step in proving your knowledge and finding employment as a computer programmer.
